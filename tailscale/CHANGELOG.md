***BREAKING CHANGES:***
- Fix DNS documentation
- Check DNS configuration

  Before upgrade :
  1. Check that under **Settings** -> **System** -> **Network** Tailscale's DNS is
     ***not*** configured as DNS server.
  1. In the command line execute `ha dns options --servers dns://100.100.100.100`.

     **Note:** _This command replaces the existing DNS server list in Home
     Assistant and restarts the internal DNS server. To specify an empty DNS list
     (i.e. to remove `dns://100.100.100.100` from the list), you must use
     `ha dns reset` and `ha dns restart` commands both. This server list is
     additional and queried before the DNS servers specified in Network settings
     above._

  This is required for the Supervisor to not lose name resolution and network connectivity.
