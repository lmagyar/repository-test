![Warning][warning_stripe]

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 100 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

You can also create an account during the add-on installation processes,
however, it is nice to know where you need to go later on.

## Installation

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** ->
   **Add-on Store**.
1. In the **...** menu at the top right corner click **Repositories**, add
   `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-tailscale` as repository.
1. Find the "Tailscale with features" add-on and click it. If it doesn't show
   up, wait until HA refreshes the information about the add-on, or click
   **Check for updates** in the **...** menu at the top right corner.
1. Click the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Start the "Tailscale with features" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale with features" add-on to see if everything
   went well.
1. Open the **Web UI** of the "Tailscale with features" add-on to complete
   authentication and couple your Home Assistant instance with your Tailscale
   account.

   **Note:** _Some browsers don't work with this step. It is recommended to
   complete this step on a desktop or laptop computer using the Chrome browser._

1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale with features" add-on again to see if
   everything went well.

## Configuration

The add-on by default exposes "Exit Node" capabilities that you can enable from
your Tailscale account. Additionally, if the Supervisor managed your network
(which is the default), the add-on will also advertise routes to your subnets on
all supported interfaces to Tailscale.

Consider disabling key expiry to avoid losing connection to your Home Assistant
device. See [Key expiry][tailscale_info_key_expiry] for more information.

Logging in to Tailscale, you can configure your Tailscale network right from
their interface.

<https://login.tailscale.com/>

1. Navigate to the [Machines page][tailscale_machines] of the admin console, and
   find your Home Assistant instance.

1. Click on the **&hellip;** icon at the right side and select the "Edit route
   settings..." option. The "Exit node" and "Subnet routes" functions can be
   enabled here.

1. Click on the **&hellip;** icon at the right side and select the "Disable key
   expiry" option.

> lost when the add-on is restarted.

### Option: `accept_dns`

This option allows you to accept the DNS settings of your tailnet that are
configured on the [DNS page][tailscale_dns] of the admin console. When disabled,
Tailscale's DNS resolves only tailnet addresses, no global nameservers from the
admin console are applied.

For more information, see the "DNS" section of this documentation.

This option is enabled by default.

### Option: `accept_routes`

This option allows you to accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes in
your tailnet.

More information: [Subnet routers][tailscale_info_subnets]

This option is disabled by default.

### Option: `advertise_exit_node`

This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node.

By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.

More information: [Exit nodes][tailscale_info_exit_nodes]

This option is enabled by default.

**Note:** You can't advertise this device as an exit node and at the same time
specify an exit node to use. See also the "Option: `exit_node`" section of this
documentation.

### Option: `advertise_connector`

This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an app connector.

When you use an app connector, you specify which applications you wish to make
accessible over your tailnet, and the domains for those applications. Any traffic
for that application is then forced over the tailnet to a node running an app
connector before egressing to the target domains. This is useful for cases where
the application has an allowlist of IP addresses which can connect to it: the IP
address of the node running the app connector can be added to the allowlist, and
all nodes on the tailnet will use that IP address for their traffic egress.

More information: [App connectors][tailscale_info_app_connectors]

This option is enabled by default.

### Option: `advertise_routes`

This option allows you to advertise routes to subnets (accessible on the network
your device is connected to) to other clients on your tailnet.

By adding to the list the IP addresses and masks of the subnet routes, you can
use it to make your devices on these subnets accessible within your tailnet.

If you want to disable this option, specify an empty list in the configuration
(`[]` in YAML).

More information: [Subnet routers][tailscale_info_subnets]

The add-on by default will advertise routes to your subnets on all supported
interfaces by adding `local_subnets` to the list.

### Option: `dscp`

This option allows you to set DSCP value on all tailscaled originated network
traffic. This allows you to handle Tailscale's network traffic on your router
separately from other network traffic.

When not set, this option is disabled by default, i.e. DSCP will be set to the
default 0. To make this option visible on the configuration editor, click "Show
unused optional configuration options" at the bottom of the page.

### Option: `exit_node`

This option allows you to specify another Tailscale instance as an exit node for
this device.

By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.

More information: [Exit nodes][tailscale_info_exit_nodes]

This option is unused by default. To make it visible on the configuration
editor, click "Show unused optional configuration options" at the bottom of the
page.

**Note:** You can't advertise this device as an exit node and at the same time
specify an exit node to use. See also the "Option: `advertise_exit_node`"
section of this documentation.

**Note:** The `exit-node-allow-lan-access` option is always enabled when an exit
node is specified. This is required by the Home Assistant environment.

### _Note on the `lets_encrypt` options below_

_Until a bug in the Supervisor/UI is not fixed (see
[#4606](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/issues/4606) and
[#2640](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/issues/2640)), we can't use
the normal configuration schema (see below) as optional values. If the issues
get fixed in the future, configuration will be changed back to something better,
like:_

```
lets_encrypt:
  certfile: fullchain.pem
  keyfile: privkey.pem
```

### Option: `lets_encrypt_certfile`

This requires `share_homeassistant` option to be enabled and set up properly.

**Important:** See also the "Option: `share_homeassistant`" section of this
documentation for the necessary configuration changes in Home Assistant!

The name of the certificate file generated by Tailscale Serve using Let's
Encrypt. Use "." to save the file with the original name containing the domain
(like "homeassistant.tail1234.ts.net.crt"), or use the regular
"fullchain.pem" or any file or folder name you prefer.

Both `lets_encrypt` options (`lets_encrypt_certfile` and `lets_encrypt_keyfile`)
has to be specified or omitted together.

**Note:** The file is stored in the /ssl/ folder (which is the default for Home
Assistant), so **_do not_** start it with "/ssl", and **_do not_** start it with
"/" either.

When not set, this option is disabled by default. To make this option visible on
the configuration editor, click "Show unused optional configuration options" at
the bottom of the page.

### Option: `lets_encrypt_keyfile`

This requires `share_homeassistant` option to be enabled and set up properly.

**Important:** See also the "Option: `share_homeassistant`" section of this
documentation for the necessary configuration changes in Home Assistant!

The name of the private key file generated by Tailscale Serve using Let's
Encrypt. Use "." to save the file with the original name containing the domain
(like "homeassistant.tail1234.ts.net.key"), or use the regular
"privkey.pem" or any file or folder name you prefer.

Both `lets_encrypt` options (`lets_encrypt_certfile` and `lets_encrypt_keyfile`)
has to be specified or omitted together.

**Note:** The file is stored in the /ssl/ folder (which is the default for Home
Assistant), so **_do not_** start it with "/ssl", and **_do not_** start it with
"/" either.

When not set, this option is disabled by default. To make this option visible on
the configuration editor, click "Show unused optional configuration options" at
the bottom of the page.

### Option: `log_level`

Optionally enable tailscaled debug messages in the add-on's log. Turn it on only
in case you are troubleshooting, because Tailscale's daemon is quite chatty. If
`log_level` is set to `info` or less severe level, the add-on also opts out of
client log upload to log.tailscale.io.

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `notice`: Normal but significant events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `login_server`

This option lets you to specify a custom control server instead of the default
(`https://controlplane.tailscale.com`). This is useful if you are running your
own Tailscale control server, for example, a self-hosted [Headscale] instance.

### Option: `share_homeassistant`

This option allows you to enable Tailscale Serve or Funnel features to present
your Home Assistant instance with a valid certificate on your tailnet or on the
internet.

This option is disabled by default.

Tailscale can provide a TLS certificate for your Home Assistant instance within
your tailnet domain.

This can prevent browsers from warning that HTTP URLs to your Home Assistant
instance look unencrypted (browsers are not aware that the connections between
Tailscale nodes are secured with end-to-end encryption).

With the Tailscale Serve feature, you can access your Home Assistant instance
with the provided certificate within your tailnet from devices already connected
to your tailnet.

With the Tailscale Funnel feature, you can access your Home Assistant instance
with the provided certificate not only within your tailnet but even from the
wider internet using your Tailscale domain (like
`https://homeassistant.tail1234.ts.net`) from devices **without installed
Tailscale VPN client** (for example, on general phones, tablets, and laptops).

**Client** &#8658; _Internet_ &#8658; **Tailscale Funnel** (TCP proxy) &#8658;
_VPN_ &#8658; **Tailscale Serve** (HTTPS proxy) &#8594; **HA** (HTTP web-server)

More information: [Enabling HTTPS][tailscale_info_https],
[Tailscale Serve][tailscale_info_serve], [Tailscale Funnel][tailscale_info_funnel].

1. Configure Home Assistant to be accessible through an HTTP connection (this is
   the default). See [HTTP integration documentation][http_integration] for more
   information. If you still want to use another HTTPS connection to access Home
   Assistant, please use a reverse proxy add-on.

1. Home Assistant, by default, blocks requests from reverse proxies, like the
   Tailscale Serve. To enable it, add the following lines to your
   `configuration.yaml`, without changing anything (don't forget to restart Home
   Assistant after the changes are saved):

   ```yaml
   http:
     use_x_forwarded_for: true
     trusted_proxies:
       - 127.0.0.1
   ```

1. Navigate to the [DNS page][tailscale_dns] of the admin console:
   - Choose a tailnet name.

   - Enable MagicDNS if not already enabled.

   - Under HTTPS Certificates section, click Enable HTTPS.

1. Optionally, if you want to use Tailscale Funnel, navigate to the [Access
   controls page][tailscale_acls] of the admin console:
   - Add the required `funnel` node attribute to the tailnet policy file. See
     [Tailnet policy file requirement][tailscale_info_funnel_policy_requirement]
     for more information.

1. Restart the add-on.

**Note**: After initial setup, it can take up to 10 minutes for the domain to
be publicly available.

**Note:** You should not use the port number in the URL that you used
previously to access Home Assistant. Tailscale Serve and Funnel works on the
default HTTPS port 443 (or the port configured in option `share_on_port`).

**Note:** If you encounter strange browser behaviour or strange error messages,
try to clear all site-related cookies, clear all browser cache, and restart the
browser.

**Note:** If you want to share other services than Home Assistant, see the
"Sharing other services with serve or funnel" section of this documentation.

### Option: `share_on_port`

This option lets you specify which port the Tailscale Serve and Funnel features
will use to present your Home Assistant instance on the tailnet and on the
internet.

Only ports 443, 8443, and 10000 are allowed by Tailscale.

Port 443 is used by default.

### Option: `snat_subnet_routes`

This option allows subnet devices to see the traffic originating from the subnet
router, and this simplifies routing configuration.

This option is enabled by default.

To support advanced [Site-to-site networking][tailscale_info_site_to_site] (e.g.
to traverse multiple networks), you can disable this functionality, and follow
steps in the [Site-to-site networking][tailscale_info_site_to_site] guide (Note:
The add-on already handles "IP address forwarding" and "Clamp the MSS to the
MTU" for you).

**Note:** Only disable this option if you fully understand the implications.
Keep it enabled if preserving the real source IP address is not critical for
your use case.

### Option: `ssh`

This option allows you to expose SSH capabilities that you can enable from your
Tailscale account.

More information: [Tailscale SSH][tailscale_info_ssh]

This option is disabled by default.

**Note**: Using Tailscale SSH you will access only this add-on's command line,
**_not_** eg. the Advanced SSH add-on's command line!

### Option: `stateful_filtering`

This option enables stateful packet filtering on packet-forwarding nodes (exit
nodes, subnet routers, and app connectors), to only allow return packets for
existing outbound connections. Inbound packets that don't belong to an existing
connection are dropped.

This option is disabled by default.

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific tags for this Tailscale instance.
They need to start with `tag:`.

More information: [Tags][tailscale_info_tags]

### Option: `taildrive`

This option allows you to specify which Home Assistant directories you want to
share with other Tailscale nodes using Taildrive.

Only the listed directories are available.

More information: [Taildrive][tailscale_info_taildrive]

### Option: `taildrop`

This add-on supports [Tailscale's Taildrop][tailscale_info_taildrop] feature,
which allows you to send files to your Home Assistant instance from other
Tailscale devices.

This option is enabled by default.

Received files are stored in the `/share/taildrop` directory.

### Option: `userspace_networking`

The add-on uses [userspace networking mode][tailscale_info_userspace_networking]
to make your Home Assistant instance (and optionally the local subnets)
accessible within your tailnet.

This option is enabled by default.

If you need to access other clients on your tailnet from your Home Assistant
instance, disable userspace networking mode, which will create a `tailscale0`
network interface on your host.

To be able to address other clients on your tailnet not only by their tailnet IP
but also by their tailnet name, see the "DNS" section of this documentation.

If you want to access other clients on your tailnet even from your local subnet,
follow steps in the [Site-to-site networking][tailscale_info_site_to_site] guide
(Note: The add-on already handles "IP address forwarding" and "Clamp the MSS to
the MTU" for you).

**Note:** In case your local subnets collide with subnet routes within your
tailnet, your local network access has priority, and these addresses won't be
routed toward your tailnet. This will prevent your Home Assistant instance from
losing network connection. This also means that using the same subnet on
multiple nodes for load balancing and failover is impossible with the current
add-on behavior.

**Note:** The `userspace_networking` option can remain enabled if you only need
one-way access from tailnet clients to your local subnet, without requiring
access from your local subnet to other tailnet clients.

**Note:** If you implement Site-to-site networking, but you are not interested
in the real source IP address, i.e. subnet devices can see the traffic
originating from the subnet router, you don't need to disable the
`snat_subnet_routes` option, this can simplify routing configuration.

## Network

### Port: `41641/udp`

UDP port to listen on for WireGuard and peer-to-peer traffic.

Use this option (and router port forwarding) if you experience that Tailscale
can't establish peer-to-peer connections to some of your devices (usually behind
CGNAT networks). You can test connections with `tailscale ping
<hostname-or-ip>`.

When not set, an automatically selected port is used by default.

## DNS

When the `userspace_networking` option is disabled, Tailscale provides a DNS (at
100.100.100.100 and fd7a:115c:a1e0::53) to be able to address other clients on
your tailnet not only by their tailnet IP but also by their tailnet name.

More information: [What is 100.100.100.100][tailscale_info_quad100],
[DNS in Tailscale][tailscale_info_dns], [MagicDNS][tailscale_info_magicdns],
[Access a Pi-hole from anywhere][tailscale_info_pi_hole].

1. Check that the `userspace_networking` option is disabled.

1. Check that under **Settings** -> **System** -> **Network** Tailscale's DNS is
   **_not_** configured as a DNS server.

1. In the command line, execute `ha dns options --servers dns://100.100.100.100`.

   **Note:** _This command replaces the existing DNS server list in Home
   Assistant and restarts the internal DNS server. To specify an empty DNS list
   (i.e. to remove `dns://100.100.100.100` from the list), you must use
   `ha dns reset` and `ha dns restart` commands both. This server list is
   additional and queried before the DNS servers specified in Network settings
   above._

**Note:** The only difference compared to the general Tailscale experience, is
that you always have to use the fully qualified domain name instead of only the
device name, i.e. `ping some-tailnet-device.tail1234.ts.net` works, but `ping
some-tailnet-device` does not work.

**Note:** If you are running your own DNS (like AdGuard) on this Home Assistant
device also, and this device is configured as global nameserver on the [DNS
page][tailscale_dns] of the admin console, then:

1. Disable the `accept_dns` option to prevent the Tailscale DNS from redirecting
   queries from your device back to itself, which would cause a loop.

1. Configure your DNS for Home Assistant, and in your DNS configure Tailscale
   DNS for your tailnet domain as upstream DNS server (e.g. in case of AdGuard
   `[/tail1234.ts.net/]100.100.100.100`).

## Healthcheck

Tailscale is quite resilient and can recover from nearly any network change. In
case it fails to recover, the add-on's health is set unhealthy. The add-on's
health is checked by Home Assistant in each 30s, and if it reports itself 3
times unhealthy in a row, the add-on will be restarted.

The add-on's health is set unhealthy:

- Once it was online and gets offline for longer than 5 minutes.

- After a (re)start can't get online for longer than 1 hour.

## Sharing other services with serve or funnel

The `share_homeassistant` option allows you to enable Tailscale Serve or Funnel
features to present your Home Assistant instance.

If you want to share other services than Home Assistant, it can be done, but
there is no add-on configuration option for this. Maybe Tailscale will add this
to the web UI in the future.

Requirements:

- You **_can't_** use the same port, that the add-on is using to share Home
  Assistant (the port that is configured under `share_on_port` option), the
  reason is that a foreground service is running on this port by the add-on, so
  you can't reuse this port, you have to use a different port (you can select
  from 443, 8443, and 10000 in case of funnel, or any port in case of serve).

- You must use the cli to set this up, but the config is permanent, you have to
  do this only once, it will work after a restart, or even backup/restore.

- Please check, that your other add-ons you want to share are using the host
  network or expose ports on the host, because you can't use anything else to
  share with Tailscale, only localhost is allowed.

- Please check, that your other add-ons are accessible through plain http,
  **_not_** https.

Steps:

1. In the cli (eg. Advanced SSH add-on
   https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh) execute: ``docker exec -it
   `docker ps -q -f name=tailscale` /bin/bash`` Now you are in this add-on's
   cli.

1. Execute something like `/opt/tailscale funnel --bg --https=8443
   --set-path=/someservice localhost:1234`

   - `serve` or `funnel`, your choice

   - `--bg` means Tailscale will start up the service in the backgroud, when the
     add-on is started, and Tailscale remembers this setting

   - `--https:8443` must be different from the add-on's serve/funnel port, or
     you will get an "foreground already exists under this port" error from
     Tailscale

   - `--set-path=/someservice` if you plan to share multiple services/ports, you
     can use different paths for each service

   - `localhost:1234` port 1234 is where your other add-on's service is
     accessible on the localhost

   - You can disable/delete this config with `/opt/tailscale funnel --bg
     --https=8443 --set-path=/someservice off`

1. You can add as many different paths as you want.

Result:

- You can access HA at https://devicename.tailxxxx.ts.net (with the help of the
  `share_homeassistant` option)

- You can access your other service at
  https://devicename.tailxxxx.ts.net:8443/someservice

**Note:** If your service is not responding at
https://devicename.tailxxxx.ts.net:8443/someservice url:

- Turn on Inspect view in your browser and check what's going on (errors,
  network communication, etc.).

- Try `--set-path=/` in the funnel config and try accessing the service at
  https://devicename.tailxxxx.ts.net:8443/.
